        # This function will allow the user to specify a function to be invoked when data
        # is written to the stderr or stdout buffers. There is a caveat to the underlying
        # libraries which casues a deadlock. The tl;dr; is that this method exists to hide
        # the complications.
        #
        # Per the documentation:
        #   stdin, stdout and stderr specify the executed program’s standard input, standard
        #   output and standard error file handles, respectively. Valid values are PIPE,
        #   DEVNULL, an existing file descriptor (a positive integer), an existing
        #   file object, and None. PIPE indicates that a new pipe to the child should be created.
        #   DEVNULL indicates that the special file os.devnull will be used. With the default
        #   settings of None, no redirection will occur; the child’s file handles will be
        #   inherited from the parent. Additionally, stderr can be STDOUT, which indicates that
        #   the stderr data from the applications should be captured into the same file handle as
        #   for stdout.
        #
        #   Note: The Popen.wait() function...
        #
        #   This will deadlock when using stdout=PIPE or stderr=PIPE and the child process
        #   generates enough output to a pipe such that it blocks waiting for the OS pipe buffer
        #   to accept more data. Use Popen.communicate() when using pipes to avoid that.

        #
        # Note:
        #   I had a strange issue when setting both stdout and stderr to subprocess.PIPE
        #   There seemed to be a deadlock until the underlying process completed;
        #   Ie. no output was being captured and no callback functions were being invoked

        # causing a deadlock for some readon.
